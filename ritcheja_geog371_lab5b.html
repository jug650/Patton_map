                <h2>Intro</h2>
                <p style="font-size: 18px">By 1942, the German's had seized control of almost all of Europe, advanced east to Moscow and Stalingrad, and controlled almost all of
                    Northern Africa. Great Britain and the Soviet Union had resist their further advancement to this point. With the United States joining the Allies after
                    the attack on Pearl Harbor, the hope was that they could halt and push back the German advances. General George Patton was one such leader that would make this
                    goal a reality. This map illustrates his movements during the war and illustrates the German retreat during that period of time.</p>
            </section>

            <section data-scene="scene2">
                <h2>Arriving in Africa in 1942</h2>
                <img src="dist/img/rommel1.jpg">
                <p style="font-size: 18px">Patton was assigned to lead the Allied invasion in the
                    French territories of Northern Africa. This campaign would be known as Operation Torch. His forces made landfall on November 8, 1942 and had captures back
                Casablanca, Morocco by November 11th. Afterwards, Patton oversaw Casablanca's transition in military
                port and hosted the famous meeting between President Roosevelt and Prime Minister Churchill known as the Casablanca Conference.</p>
                <p style="font-size: 18px">Due to his great success, the German's enlisted their top battlefield commander, General Erwin Rommel.
                Rommel was successful at the Battle of Kasserine Pass on March 6, 1943, which led to Patton assuming command of the II Corps. At which
                time, Patton made many operational changes that were intended to increase his troops discipline and effectiveness.
                From that point on, Patton had the German's on the run. Begining with his victory at the Battle of El Guettar on March 17, 1943.</p>
                <p style="font-size: 18px">After he successfully drove the Germans out of Africa, he handed over command of the II Corps to General Omar
                    Bradly. At which time, Patton returned to Casablanca to plan for the Allied invasion of the island of Sicily.</p>

            <section data-scene="scene3">
                <h2>Sicily Campaign</h2>
                <img src="dist/img/patton_sicily1.jpg">
                <p style="font-size: 18px">Patton took command of the Seventh Army, which was comprised of 90,000 men. His forces
                made landfall in Sicily on July 10, 1943. This campaign would be known as Operation Husky. Along with the British General
                Bernard Montgomery, their goal was to retake the island. However, a strong rivalry would form between the two generals. This lead
                Patton to taking some actions that were seemed controversial. One such case was when he was ordered to hault his attack on Messina. His staff responded to
                the order by claiming that they were not receiving there transmission. After that, Patton continued his attack and captured Messina anyways. Perhaps his most famous
                    incident was when he slapped two of his men that were being treated for "battle fatigue". Believing that this condition was a cowardly way to get out of the fight,
                    Patton ordered both men back to the front. For these actions, he was punished personally by General Dwight Eisenhower. Many believe that his aggressive behavior was
                    fueled by his desire to out perform Montgomery in pushing the German and Italians from the island. Ultimately, he was successful when the last Axis troops, 40,000 Germans and 70,000 Italians, evacuated the island.

                <h2>Phantom Army</h2>
                <img src="dist/img/d-day1.jpg">
                <p style="font-size: 18px">Realizing that the Germans regarded Patton as the best Allied battle commander, the Allies developed a plan called Operation Fortitude. The plan was to develop a false plan of attack of attack for the Allied Normandy invasion.
                    The German's simply could not believe that Patton would not be involved in the Normandy invasion. Using Patton as a decoy, the Allies real battle plan would be known as Operation Overload and was executed on June 6, 1944.</p>
            </section>

            <section data-scene="scene5">
                <h2>Normandy and Battle of the Bulge</h2>
                <img src="dist/img/bulge1.jpg">
                <p style="font-size: 18px">After D-Day, Patton's Third Army became active on August 1, 1944. He was tasked with attacking to the south and east flank of the Allied forces.
                Meet with lighter resistance, Patton again relied on speed to overwhelm the German forces. They were progressing at a rate of 60 miles every two weeks.
                    To sustain such a rate, Patton relied greatly on reliable intelegence. Luckily for him, his forces possessed more intelligence officers than any of the other.</p>
            <p style="font-size: 18px">By December of 1942, the German's knew that things were getting desperate. In a last ditch effort to turn the tide, they launched a major offensive across
                Belgium, Luxembourg, and northern France. This would be known as the Battle of the Bulge. General Eisenhower asked Patton to develop a plan that would push back the Germans and relieve
            the men of the 101st Airbourne that were completely surrounded in the city of Bastogne. On December 22, Patton was ordered to counter attack. Within days, he had mobilized 133,000 vehicles to move the troops and supplies that
            would be needed to retake the area. By December 26th, his forces had reached Bastogne. He was quoted as saying the this campaign was "the most brilliant operation
            we have thus performed, and it is in my opinion the outstanding achievement of the war. This is my biggest battle." Confident as ever.</p>

                <h2>Push into Germany</h2>
                <p style="font-size: 18px">By March of the following year, Patton's Third Army had captured a sizable portion of western Germany. If fact, it is said that Patton was ordered to
                bypass the city of Trier due to the belief that it would take 4 army division. His response to the order was, "Have taken Trier with two divisions. Do you want me to give it back?" Again highlighting his persona. Wanting to reach Berlin before the Soviets, he was instead ordered to push to Bavaria. He ultimately stopped just before reaching Prague, when the Germans surrendered
                    on May 8, 1945, ending the war in Europe.</p>

                <h2 >Death in Heidelberg</h2>
                <p style="font-size: 18px">After the conclusion of the war in Europe, Patton tried very hard to get a command in the Pacific theater. He took some extended leave to see family and visit families of the fallen soldiers. After his rest, Patton was appointed the military governor of Bavaria. When the war concluded, Patton felt that he had no purpose and his behavior had become
                more erratic. After making some controversial comments to the press about the Nazi Party, Eisenhower relieved him of his governorship and command of the Third Army in the fall of 1945. His last command would be the 15th US Army based in Bad Nauheim, Germany. On December 8, 1945, Patton was on his way to hunt pheasants when he was in a severe car crash. Bleeding badly and having a severe strike to the head, he was rushed to the
                hospital in Heildberg. There it was discovered that he had a fractured neck and was paralyzed. Due to the complications of his injury, he died of pulmonary edema and congestive heart failure on December 21, 1945. As per his request, he was buried at the Luxembourg American Cemetery next to the his men that were lost from the Third Army.</p>
